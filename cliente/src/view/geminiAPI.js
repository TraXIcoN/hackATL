In order to minimize the effects of increasing urbanization and aging electrical infrastrucure
The existential problem modern cities face:
Increasing urbanization: 
global warming drives more and more peoples into cities
Electric demand outpaces aging infrastructure capabilities 
People in cities need more AC to have livable live or be productive
Increased usage and temperature lead to power grid transmission deterioration.

What are the consequences?

If problem is not addressed, then there will be power outages that have dangerous and expensive consequence. Assume the impact on lifesaving treatments in hospitals. the economic impact if factories are shut down or workers are stuck in traffic chaos or stuck subway tunnels and phone or internet communication don’t work.

What options do we have?
Build a bigger, stronger electricity power grid.
This is expensive and takes a long time
Produce or store power close to where it is consumed
Decentralized power generation and storage.

Power grids and power utility companies were always central since they were big, expensive, and many times caused a lot of pollution, but times have changed.

Urban Pulse is the answer! 

We believe the solution is a decentralized power generation and storage utilizing the latest advancements in technology, science, and internetication of practically any consumer device.

What is Urban Pulse ?

At its core Urban Pulse  is an optimization process that uses the current grid capacity, electricity prices, consumer device readings, and weather patterns to produce a sophisticated model that controls three things:

Control or shut-down non-essential or high energy consumption home devices to preserve power 
Charging of batteries connected to the Urban Pulse  network
Release power from the batteries into the official power grid.

The effect of all these actions as modern day, AI powered electricity broker. Urban Pulse  makes money by selling energy saving subscriptions, buying energy cheaply at off peak prices/selling it expensively at peak prices and later by producing electricity locally with solar panels. 


How does it actually work?

In short, the sum of many small installations will have a big impact on the electricity grid and will contribute to sustainable, healthy lives for city residents. 

Phase 1: Power saving subscriptions. 
Gain traction with consumers and gather data to fine-tune tune AI model.

Phase 2: Buildout battery network with ‘charge back’ capabilities 
Work with innercity condos and businesses to install battery capacity to allow charging back into the electricity grid. Work with EV car changing companies if the car batteries can be used to ‘charge back’ electricity into the electricity grid at peak time, but at a minimum, enable slow charging during high utilization periods.


Phase 3: Buildout high-efficiency solar panel network
Work with city buildings to get permits to install solar panels on their roof tops to charge the pre-installed batteries.


How do we actually make money?

Profitability outlook - very good!

The profit margins will widen over time since the electricity keeps getting more and more expensive. Once Urban Pulse  produces most of its power through solar panels, the profit margin is only limited by the precision of the AI model prediction and the amount of solar/battery capacity installed.
